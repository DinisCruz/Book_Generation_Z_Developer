  - In this book/essay Raymond provides 19 lessons which are still as relevant today (2018) as when they were published (1998)

     - Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
     - Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
     - Plan to throw one [version] away; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederick Brooks' The Mythical Man-Month)
     - If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
     - When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
     - Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
     - Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.
     - Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
     - Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
     - If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
     - The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
     - Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
     - Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. (Attributed to Antoine de Saint-Exupéry)
     - Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
     - When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
     - When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend.
     - A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
     - To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
     - Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.
