Hi Generation Z Developer, if you are one and want to learn as much as you can about your craft, this is the book for you.

I decided to write this book after doing a series of presentations to Gen Z audiences. As part of this process I discovered gaps in your generation's understanding of the history behind a number of key ideas and technologies that underpin the technological revolution that we are the in middle of. I also wanted to share a number of real-world concepts, practices and technologies that will make you a much better and effective professional in today's highly competitive tech world. 

Here is the slide that started it all in 2017, how many logos do you recognize?

The presentation started with me asking the audience if the logos looked familiar. I soon realised that, not only did the audience not recognize most of the logos, they didn't know the history behind them. More importantly, the audience didn't understand the story behind **why** they where created nor they were aware of the problem (or itch) they originally looked to address.

Why is the **why** important? All of these icons were 'catalysts for change'. It is important to understand the history behind them, why they occurred and the change they drove. Each one of these icons changed the world of technology, and created paradigms shifts that still impact our world today.

For example, one of the really significant innovations was the creation of the Creative Commons license - an adaption of a traditional copyright license. This was one of my initial _'WFT! you don't know what Creation Commons is???'_ realizations. 

Creative Commons licensing gives a number of rights to the consumer of creations (rather than the originator of a creation holding onto the rights). It allows ideas, creations and concepts to spread easily and without limitation. 

This book is released under a 'Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License'. This license means, amongst other things, that you are free (as in 'entitled to') to use all the material and content from this book. The only requirement on your part being around acknowledgement of the author and source attribution. You can even sell other books and any derived work based on the content from this book.

Fundamentally, the freedom of knowledge isn't a new idea but the real impact of Creative Commons was about how it became applied to technology, an industry often dominated solely by commercial interests. For better or worse, the closed approach has shaped the technology and systems that dominate the world today. As you will see through the book, what I find interesting is not a particular technology or idea, but the ways in which those ideas change how we act, think and behave.

We are in the middle of a massive technological and cultural revolution and you have the opportunity to decide if you want to be a pawn, a player or even a play-maker in this new world. By understanding the history, thinking and mechanics of this change you will be in the best position to adapt and thrive. If you don't understand the past, you are not only bound to repeat its mistakes but also miss opportunities you may not even be aware of.

Please join me in this interesting trip down memory lane, where I will try to explain how I understand and learned from a multitude number of technologies, ideas and events.
