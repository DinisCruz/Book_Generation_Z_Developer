Generation Z is the generation born after 1996](https://twitter.com/PaoliCGPI/status/961121404048601088). Like all generation boundaries, their differences may be generalized and there will always be exceptions to this rule. That said, when viewed constructively, it represents an interesting mix of great values and digital capabilities.

The older members of this generation (at the time of writing, 2018) are about 22 years old. They were 11 when the first iPhone came out (2007) and are the first real 'born online' generation. In parts of the world privileged enough to enjoy ubiquitous access to technology, many members of this generation have not experienced a world without ready access to the internet on some kind of device. This is the generation that is entering the job market right now.

I have personal experience of this generation, I have two daughters currently aged 13 and 15, and I have also been professionally involved in a number of projects focused on Generation Z. I've run sessions teaching UK high school kids how to 'hack' (in the ethical rather than illegal sense of the word) and even younger developers how to code so they would be able to apply their skills in real world scenarios. 

I'm focusing on this Generation because I believe they've missed the historical understanding of a number of key technological revolutions required to be competitive in the market place. At the current pace of technological advancement so much history can be taken for granted. Without a full understanding of the past, we only learn from shadows and curated versions of reality.

**I'm worried about Gen Z**

Although Generation Z have some spectacular traits and values, I occasionally perceive a lack of intellectual curiosity that worries me. This is arguably the most tolerant and diversity-aware generation. But, having grown up with an innate acceptance of the technology around us, many of the building blocks of today's technology stacks are simply assumed to be ever present. Much like driving a car or flying a plane with no knowledge of the engineering involved. 

This is a huge advantage in a sense; many of the older generation perceived boundaries don't inhibit Generation Z. By the same token, even more opportunies can come from understanding the origin, history and evolution of the technology journey so far.

This is an age when information and knowledge is often a Google search away. Yet, conversation after conversation I've found - perhaps unsurprisingly - that Generation Z teenagers have a very superficial understanding of the history that underpins the technologies they use. How and why this technology came to be in the first place and the original problems it tried to solve.

My hope with this book is to fill these gaps and provide context and references to inform and enable better decision making. For those doubters among you remember: this generation will eventually need to save the world from the mess previous generations have created.

**Overwhelming curiosity**

How will I know if this book has succeded in its quest? I'm hopeful that the reader can enjoy a few moments of overwhelming curiosity and go on learning more about a certain topic. Moments when you may wish to follow link after link about a particular topic, and that regardless of its depth and depth you may think 'WOW, that is fr**** awesome!'.

If you are lucky enough to find yourself in this place, congratulations! You just found 'the zone'. An amazing mental lace where you have the chance to be single minded and 100% absorbed. This is the best way to learn.

Whenever you find yourself in this headspace, dont stop! Follow it as long as your brain allows it, and don't stop for anything. Social events, eating and sleeping can always wait (more or less; respect your physical and mental health and never take them for granted). The 'zone' is a magical place to be, so learn to recognize when you are in it and explore it as much as you can.
