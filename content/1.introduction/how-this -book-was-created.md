This book is being created using the principles and technologies described in this book :)

 - All content is available under an CC License (Creative Commons)
 - Markdown is used to write the content
 - All content is managed using git and published under a public GitHub repository
 - GitHub Issues are used to track bugs, issues and ideas 
 - Leanpub is used to create and publish the digital versions of this book
 - Content is being published early and often on Leanpub and on some blogs (to share the ideas, get feedback and build community) 

 If you have never used git, github or markdown, why don't you help out in the creation of this book? You can do this by opening up issues with your feedback on the ideas and content (I really value those comments since it helps me to make sure the content makes sense to the target audience)
