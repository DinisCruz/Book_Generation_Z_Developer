status: draft

...

**Topics to cover and ideas**
  
 - a very effective way to learn is to list to comments and views on how you behave and act (i.e. being criticized)
 - put your self in situations where everybody feels conformance
 - my story about play drums and who to listen
    - most musicians are not very good teachers and unless don't know how to give effective feedback (usually to much focus on technical aspect of the playing)
    - but they are not the target audience
 - learn to like it
 - be humble when receiving feedback and appreciate that it is very hard for the other person to do it (since they are going on the record and in most cases it is easier to not say anything)
 - if somebody has something to say to you , but is afraid to say it or thinks that it wont matter because you will not listen, the real loser in this (lack of communication) is you
 - listening to somebody doesn't mean that you have to agree with what they say 
    - part of the exercise is to tune in your understanding of reality with reality
    - you can't control how somebody will react to your actions. so don't fight it and use those reasons in your feedback loop in become a better person, professional and manager

 - note that I have put a lot of personal effort and thought in improming mysekf since sometimes due to my high levels of energy I can be quite un-sensitive. See [Why do others think that I'm "hard to deal with" and that "I don't listen"](http://blog.diniscruz.com/2012/10/why-do-others-think-that-im-hard-to.html)
