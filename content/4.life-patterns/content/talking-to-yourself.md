title : Talking to yourself digitally

Talking to yourself in an digital way is not a sign of madness :)

It is a sign that you are capturing your ideas, knowledge and workflow. 

I do this a lot, since I find that it gives me a way to capture what I'm doing in a format that I can easily access later. I'm hyperlinking my knowledge/ideas and speaking to my future self.

By talking to yourself, I basically mean that you are having digital threads (on git commits, github threads, blogs, twitter or slack) where the main person talking (i.e. adding digital content) is you. You describe a problem you have, you write possible solutions and when you find the answer you document that too.

It is very important to be comfortable in talking to yourself digitally, since it is not easy and it can feel quite awkward. But it is totally worth it, usually the main beneficially of those threads is actually you (I have many examples of years later finding blog posts I wrote where the step-by-step details I posted help me not to have to solve the same problem again). That said one of the loneliest moments you can have is when you have a particular problem and the only thread you find on the Internet is actually you a couple years ago talking about that problem and asking for help (it is in that moment that you realise that you are the only one in the world that cares about that issue :) ) 

Usually the reason why you will not do this is because you think (wrongly) that:

 -  **Nobody will be interested in this info** - this is wrong. Posting your ideas and workflows will help others to understand your thinking and actions. It leaves your workflow behind, which is where the really learning occurs. The worse part is that if you do document the solution later, when describing a journey from 'A to F', you will describe the final solution as linear A, B,C,D,E and F steps. In fact, in practice when solving the problem the first time, you actually went on an number of tangents which are as interesting and valuable as the final solution. In this 'A to F' example the path you took was actually A,B, G, M,Z, T, E, D and finally the F steps (usually the final solution was not discovered in an linear and in-sequence way)    
 -  **This info is obvious** - caused by the 'curse of knowledge' where now that you understand it, the solution is obvious (except that it wasn't obvious to you before you solved it)
 - **I will look stupid by asking this question (and providing the answer)** - There are no stupid questions! If you did not knew the answer then that was a valid question (usually the gap is in the way knowledge is shared and captured in your environment). Everybody was a novice once, and did not know that answer! That said, what can be very annoying and counter-productive are the individuals that keep asking the same question and not learning (so as long as you keep learning, you should share your questions, and when you find them, your answers). In fact a really good side effect (in teams) for sharing simpler questions, is that it lowers the bar of what is a question that can be asked, and it can dramatically increases collaboration and team knowledge propagation.
 - **Who am I to say this** - caused by 'impostor syndrome' where you are your worse enemy
