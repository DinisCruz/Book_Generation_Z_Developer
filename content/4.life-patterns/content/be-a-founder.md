The single thing that you personally control when you go to work, is your attitude to your work and how you approach it.

One of the concepts that I really like is the idea that you should _"act like one of the founders of the business"_.

Image you where employee #4 and you really cared deeply about the company you currently are working on!

Ask yourself:

 _**"If I was a founder of the company/department/section I work now, with the responsibilities that I have at the moment: "**_

   - _"How would I behave everyday?"_
   - _"What needs to be done now, that will make a big difference?"_
   - _"What can I do that will help?"_
   - _"What would I do differently?"_
   - _"What values and principles would I fight for?"_

Hopefully you will get some interesting ideas and actions (from this mental exercise)

The question now is: _"what is stopping you from doing just that?"_

Who is telling you _"Don't do it"_?

At the moment it is just you!

You can even do this for companies that don't employ you. You can contribute to their open source projects, you can write blog posts about them (and use twitter to reach out to key individuals)

You can choose to care about the team that you are currently in, and the work that needs to be done.

The irony is that the more you care and the more you behave like a founder, the more value you usually add and the more valuable you will become for that company.
