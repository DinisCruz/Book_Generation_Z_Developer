[OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/) (the Open Web Application Security Project) is a worldwide organization focused on Application Security. We are the good guys that are trying to make the world a safer place :)

I have been heavily involved in OWASP for a long time, and it is one of the more open, friendly, knowledgeable and carer-enhancing communities you can find. I've meet some of my best friends in the industry though OWASP and what I've learned from its projects and events is too long to list here :) 

There are many ways that actively participating in OWASP will make you a better developer and enhance your carer. Part of building your brand, skills and network is the participation in Open Source communities, and OWASP is a a perfect place to do that.

The first place to start is your local Owasp Chapter. With [100s of chapters](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Chapter) worldwide, you shouldn't be to far from one (if not then [start one](https://www.tfaforms.com/261541), the London Chapter started many years ago over beers in a London pub). Attend a chapter meeting, learn something new and create connections.

Next step is to check out the [OWASP projects](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Project#tab=Project_Inventory) and see which ones are relevant to your current work/research, and more importantly, which ones you should be involved as a contributor. Most OWASP projects, even the bigger and most successful ones, are usually maintained by only a couple individuals, and ALL projects are desperate for contributors and help! It is not that hard to start, just fork the project in GitHub, see the open issues and start sending the Pull Requests.

Check out the main [OWASP Conferences](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AppSec_Conference) and events like the [Open Security Summit](https://open-security-summit.org/) which are amazing places to learn and meet highly talented professionals, all happy to share knowledge and teach.

Finally, join up [OWASP Slack](http://owaspslack.com) where you will find everybody and 100s of channels dedicated to everything OWASP related (projects, chapters, conferences, topics)

### Find jobs via OWASP contributions

Due to its open nature and focus on finding solutions for hard problems (related to application security), OWASP's community is made by the 'doers', i.e. the ones that actually get things done at companies and know what they are doing. 

This means that regardless if you want to want to get a job in an security team, active participation in OWASP projects is a perfect and very effective way to meet individuals that can help you find the job you want.

That said, there is a massive skills shortage in the market for Application Security specialists. The main reason is because you can't really do Application Security unless you have a developer background. My advise to all developers I meet, is to seriously consider an Application Security carer. Not only it is an industry that is on a massive growth curve, it really needs new talent, energy, development skill and ideas.
